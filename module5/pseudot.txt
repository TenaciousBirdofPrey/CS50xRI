do the following while fgetc(stdin) is not return and is not the end of file
    append(c)
        create a new node
        put c in that node
        set the next value to null
        is head  is set to null?
            make head equal to the address of this new node
            and break from this loop
        if not continue in loop
            create a pointer called curr and make it equal to head.
                while the value of curr isn't null
                curr will equal the adrres of the next node
                once the value of curr is null
                change it so it points to the newnoded.
